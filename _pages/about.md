AmsterdamNLP is an initiative of the computational linguists in the Language and Computation group of the [ILLC](https://www.illc.uva.nl) at the University of Amsterdam. We aim to collect and share information about results, papers and events relevant for anyone professionally interested in NLP in the Amsterdam area. Academic research in NLP in Amsterdam is distributed over two universities and multiple institutes and departments. The NLP-group/CL-group at ILLC is the largest cluster of NLP researchers in Amsterdam, but there are a lot of other researchers in Amsterdam working on NLP technology and even more working with NLP technology.
