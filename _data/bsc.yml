    This is a second-year course offered to students in the Bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence programme of the University of Amsterdam. The course covers some of the essential techniques in natural language processing with a focus on language modelling and word representation:

    * Review of probability theory
    * Probability of a setence
    * Markov Models and n-gram language modelling
    * Hidden Markov Models and part of speech tagging
    * Probabilistic context-free grammars
