An afternoon with ChatGPT: A discussion of generative language models & its impact on the university

Everyone is talking about ChatGPT, and many predict that it and similar 'large language models' will have a major impact on education, learning, science and publishing.

On Tuesday 24/1 at 3pm, the ILLC -- home to Amsterdam's largest research group studying language models -- invites lecturers, students and collaborators to an afternoon on ChatGPT & the university. The event is at Lab42, Science Park 900, room L1.01.

How does it work? What can it do, and what can it not do? What are some of the ehtical and legal dilemma's when using this technology? We'll have some short talks and demonstrations, and plenty of time to answer your questions.With: Prof Raquel Fern√°ndez (dialogue systems), Prof Robert van Rooij (semantics), Dr Jelle Zuidema (explainable AI), Dr Jelke Bloem (digital humanities), Dr. Sandro Pezelle (responsible AI), Ece Takmaz (vision-language models), Mario Guilianelli (language generation), and others.
