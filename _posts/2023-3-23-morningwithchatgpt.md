### A morning with ChatGPT: A discussion of generative language models & its impact on the university


Everyone is talking about ChatGPT, and many predict that it and similar 'large language models' will have a major impact on education, learning, science and publishing. The [ILLC](http://www.illc.uva.nl) -- home to Amsterdam's largest research group studying language models -- invites lecturers, students and collaborators to an afternoon on **ChatGPT & the university**. 

How does it work? What can it do, and what can it not do? What are some of the ethical and legal dilemma's when using this technology? We'll have some short talks and demonstrations, and plenty of time to answer your questions.With: Prof Raquel Fern√°ndez (*dialogue systems*),  Dr Jelle Zuidema (*explainable AI*), Dr Jelke Bloem (*digital humanities*), Dr. Sandro Pezelle (*responsible AI*), Dr Marjolein Lanzing (*philosophy of technology*) and others.
